## Credits

This project was created as part of a learning experience and is inspired by the Codecademy "Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages" curriculum.

# Off-Platform Project: Colmar Academy

I worked with Git and GitHub on my local machine for this project. This website is also optimized for mobile devices.
